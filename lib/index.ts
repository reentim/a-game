// TODO
// keyword arguments would be nice

// default arguments for constructors

// what about, since I'm so into space, a space game? would also suit lowbit
// graphics
// could be lander & shooter
// with bearing -- like Pirates!
// full fucking Homeworld
//
// takes on other games, Stronghold with more economics
//
// Actually: lander shooter thing
// orbital mechanics like osmsos
// some lander stuff
// some homeworld stuff
//
// or narrow it down to lander game, but you start off as the lunar module,
// have to do all the stuff
